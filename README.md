CPSC 233: ALgorithms and Abstract Data Structures
=================================================
All files created during the Fall 2019 semester of CPSC 223 at Gonzaga University  

## HW1: C++ review
Review of C++ concepts from CPSC 121 and CPSC 122
* inheritence
* OOP design
  
## HW2: C++ review 
Review of C++ concepts from CPSC 121 and CPSC 122
* three-file format
* algorithm development

## HW3: Vector Collection
Custom collection class created that is used with a test driver file to compare the efficiency of algorithms created during the class. Main focus of the assignment is to create a vector-based collection class with parameterized keys and values  

## HW4: Linked List Collection
Collection class created using a linked list data structure
* Nodes store a parameterized key and value
* Assignment was also a review of pointers from CPSC 122

## HW5: Binary Search Collection (vector-based)
Collection class created using a vector and the binary search alogrithm  
The algorithm is used to
* find an  element
* find correct location for insert or removal
* find a range of elements

## HW6: Sorting ALgorithms
Implemented 3 sorting algorithms on a linked list data structure
1. Insertion Sort
1. Merge Sort
1. Quick Sort
Goal of assignment was to understand the steps of sorting algoritms and compare their complexites

## HW7: Hash Table Collection
Collection class implemented using a hash table with seperate chaining. A paremeterized key and value are stored as a single node in the table

## HW8: Binary Search Tree Collection
Collection class implemented using a binary search tree data structure. The first node in a null tree is stored as the root, all subsequent nodes are stores as the left or right child of a node. Only the insert method and all other collection class methods are implemented

## HW9: Binary Search Tree Collection
Collection class implemented using a binary search tree data structure. Removal method and rebalancing methods implemented

## HW10: Red Black Tree
Collection class implemented using a red black tree data structure. Only the insert, and the bottom-up rebalance methods were implemented

## HW11: Red Black Tree
Collection class implemented using a red black tree data structure. Both the insert and remove methods, and their respective rebalance methods, were implemented. Additionally, a double black recolor method was implemented
